# calix-python-api
This is a python based calix API script thingy!

# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED
The Python CMS NBI development was halted in the month of July, 2016. All focuses and production has moved to the JSON based NBI-API. http://gregorybrewster.com/?p=1155

I have not tested this repo, and may not work out of the box. It was pulled from a backup from a production environment. Some savy guy can take the idea and run with it :)
